   abstract = {Multi-sensor data fusion (MSDF) is defined as the process of integrating information from multiple sources to produce the most specific and comprehensive unified data about an entity, activity or event. As a technology, MSDF is the integration and application of many traditional disciplines and new areas of engineering including communication and decision theory, uncertainty management, estimation theory, digital signal processing, computer science and artificial intelligence. MSDF is expected to result in robust operational performance, extended spatial coverage, increased confidence, reduced ambi- guity, improved detection performance, enhanced spatial resolution, improved system operational reliability and increased dimensionality (Hall 1992). At a basic level the processing operations are dominated by numeric procedures involving linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, pattern recognition processes and various statistical operations. For a flight test range the tracking of the flight vehicle and sensor fusion are of great importance. In the present paper, U-D factorized Kalman filter, state vector fusion filter and a fusion philosophy are described. The composite scheme is termed UDFF based MSDF strategy. The strategy is validated using post flight data.},

The determination of suitability is supported by data from real measurements. The thesis firstly gives an overview of communication solutions that are usable for aerial platforms and then looks closely to the problematics of radio frequency signal propagation, and to communication in wireless mobile networks. The mobile telecommunications and RF modem communication are tested and compared to each other giving differences and recommendations for particular areas of use are suggested.},

   abstract = {This paper concerns a problem which is basic to perception: the integration of perceptual information into a coherent description of the world. In this paper we present perception as a process of dynamically maintaining a model of the local external environment. Fusion of perceptual information is at the heart of this process. After a brief introduction, we review the background of the problem of fusion in machine vision. We then present fusion as part of the process of dynamic world modelling, and postulate a set of principles for the 'fusion' of independent observations. These principles lead to techniques which permit perceptual fusion with qualitatively different forms of data, treating each source of information as constraints. For numerical information, these principles lead to specific well known tools such as various forms of Kalman filter and Mahalanobis distance. For symbolic information, these principles suggest representing objects and their relations as a conjunction of properties encoded as schema. Dynamic world modelling is a cyclic process composed of the phases: predict, match and update. These phases provide a framework with which we can organize and design perceptual systems. We show that in the case of numerical measurements, this framework leads to the use of a form of Kalman filter for the prediction and update phases, while a Mahalanobis distance is used for matching. In the case of symbolic information, elements of the framework can be constructed with schema and production rules. The framework for perceptual information is illustrated with the architectures of several systems. © 1993.},

   abstract = {This paper details the initial design and plan- ning of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implemented control system that will enable a path planner to interact with a MAVLink based flight computer. The design is aimed at small Unmanned Aircraft Vehi- cles (UAV) under autonomous operation which are typically subject to constraints arising from limited on-board processing capabilities, power and size. An FPGA implementation for the de- sign is chosen for its potential to address such limitations through low power and high speed in-hardware computation. The MAVLink pro- tocol offers a low bandwidth interface for the FPGA implemented path planner to communi- cate with an on-board flight computer. A con- trol system plan is presented that is capable of accepting a string of GPS waypoints gener- ated on-board from a previously developed in- hardware Genetic Algorithm (GA) path plan- ner and feeding them to the open source PX4 autopilot, while simultaneously respond- ing with flight status information. 1},

With an accuracy of few centimeters and measurement rates of 1000 measurements per second LPM is by now one of the most advanced systems in this field. For sensor fusion purposes each transponder is equipped with a telemetry channel. In this contribution we discuss the sensor fusion of the position measurements of the LPM system with accelerometers and gyroscopes. The focus of this work is to investigate the impact of additional sensor information on the accuracy of the estimated states based on different state transition matrices of a Kalman filter. The results based on synthetic data are verified by measurements of a test car on a race track},

   abstract = {The Kalman filter has been the work horse in model based filtering for five decades, and basic knowledge and understanding of it is an important part of the curriculum in many Master of Science programs. It is therefore important to combine theoretical studies with practical experience to allow the students to deepen their understanding of the filter. We have developed a lab where the students implement a Kalman filter in a real-time Matlab framework, to which data are streamed from the smartphone over WiFi. The goal of the lab is to estimate the orientation of the smartphone, which can be nicely visualized graphically and also be compared to the built-in filters in the smartphone. The filter can accept any combination of sensor data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometer, with different performance. Different tunings and tricks in the Kalman filter are easily evaluated on-line. The smartphone app is also a stand-alone tool to visualize the sensor data graphically. So far the lab seems tohave been successful in reaching the pedagogic goals and to engage the students.},

   abstract = {© 2017 Shangqiu Shan et al. In this paper, a new Kalman filtering scheme is designed in order to give the optimal attitude estimation with gyroscopic data and a single vector observation. The quaternion kinematic equation is adopted as the state model while the quaternion of the attitude determination from a strapdown sensor is treated as the measurement. Derivations of the attitude solution from a single vector observation along with its variance analysis are presented. The proposed filter is named as the Single Vector Observation Linear Kalman filter (SVO-LKF). Flexible design of the filter facilitates fast execution speed with respect to other filters with linearization. Simulations and experiments are conducted in the presence of large external acceleration and magnetic distortion. The results show that, compared with representative filtering methods and attitude observers, the SVO-LKF owns the best estimation accuracy and it consumes much less time in the fusion process.},

   abstract = {© 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. A telemetry system for real-time monitoring of the motions, position, speed and course of a ship at sea is presented in this work. The system, conceived as a subsystem of a radar cross-section measurement unit, could also be used in other applications as ships dynamics characterization, on-board cranes, antenna stabilizers, etc. This system was designed to be stand-alone, reliable, easy to deploy, low-cost and free of requirements related to stabilization procedures. In order to achieve such a unique combination of functionalities, we have developed a telemetry system based on redundant inertial and magnetic sensors and GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements. It provides a proper data storage and also has real-time radio data transmission capabilities to an on-shore station. The output of the system can be used either for on-line or off-line processing. Additionally, the system uses dual technologies and COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) components. Motion-positioning measurements and radio data link tests were successfully carried out in several ships of the Spanish Navy, proving the compliance with the design targets and validating our telemetry system.},

Continuous-time decentralized Kalman filters (DKF) are used as data fusion devices on local subsystems. Such a structure gives the flexibility for reconfiguration of a control system. New subsystems can easily be added without needing any redesign of the whole system. The system does not require a central processor and therefore, in the case of failure of local subsystems (each of which includes a local processor, sensors and actuators) the overall system will continue to work. The simulation results show that the performance of the overall system degrades gracefully even if the sensors of subsystems fail or interconnections are broken. Furthermore, local Kalman filters can effectively reduce subsystem and measurement noise.},
