\section{Theoretical Background}

This study is anchored on three major theories: the Rental System Theory, the Sustainable Energy and Portable Power Theory, and the Wireless Communication and Positioning Theory (GPS and GSM Modules). Together, these theories explain the technological and operational principles underlying the development and functionality of the Kuryenta system, a coin-operated detachable power rental station designed to provide accessible, sustainable, and flexible energy solutions to users.

\subsection{Rental System Theory}
The Rental System Theory provides the conceptual basis for automating resource access and transactions through integrated digital and physical mechanisms. Thakur (2021) describes how an online rental platform enables users to register, reserve, and manage bookings remotely, transforming manual rental procedures into efficient, automated workflows. Applied to the Kuryenta system, this theory explains the combined use of a mobile application and on-station hardware (coin slot and solenoid mechanism) to control access to detachable power units. Users register and select an available slot via the application, then complete the physical payment at the station; the system computes the rental fee dynamically, based on the detachable unit’s remaining battery percentage, and upon successful payment, actuates the solenoid to release the unit for a fixed rental duration. The integration of automated payment, real-time availability, and credit-storage mechanisms embodies core principles of rental system theory by increasing operational efficiency, ensuring transparent transaction management, and improving user convenience. These features align with Thakur’s (2021) emphasis on system integration, automated database updates, and user-centred service delivery in modern rental platforms

\subsection{Sustainable Energy and Portable Power Theory}

The Sustainable Energy and Portable Power Theory supports the selection and design of renewable, off-grid power solutions and portable energy storage for resilient, community-oriented services. Recent implementations of coin-operated solar charging stations demonstrate how photovoltaic energy harvesting coupled with integrated storage batteries can provide continuous, low-maintenance charging services with commercial and emergency applications (Catalan et al., 2023). Complementing this, Gozano et al. (2023) provide empirical evidence for the design and deployment of portable, modular battery packs charged by solar panels, including component sizing (PV, inverter, charge controller), battery configuration, and performance monitoring via Arduino data logging, to reliably serve remote communities. Applying these principles to Kuryenta justifies the use of detachable battery with an onboard inverter and supports design decisions such as panel and battery sizing, battery management (BMS/modularity), and performance validation protocols. Together, these studies reinforce key theoretical aspects of the Kuryenta system: energy sustainability (solar charging), adaptability (modular/detachable units and inverter capability for low–medium appliances), operational resilience (off-grid emergency use), and evidence-based system sizing and monitoring for effective, user-centered portable power delivery.


\subsection{Wireless Communication and Positioning Theory (GPS and GSM Modules)}

The Wireless Communication and Positioning Theory serves as the foundation for the integration of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modules within the proposed system. This theory emphasizes the use of satellite-based navigation and mobile communication technologies to enable real-time tracking, monitoring, and data transmission over long distances. According to San Hlaing, Naing, and San Naing (2019), the integration of GPS and GSM enables efficient and continuous monitoring of mobile assets by acquiring geographic coordinates and transmitting them via wireless networks to designated users or databases.

In the context of this study, the theory supports the functionality of tracking and monitoring the location of detachable power sources within the rental system. The GPS module gathers real-time location data, while the GSM module transmits these coordinates to the mobile application and administrative system. Through this process, users and administrators are able to monitor the deployed power units, ensuring accountability, operational transparency, and user security. This theoretical foundation highlights the importance of wireless connectivity and geolocation in developing intelligent systems that enhance mobility, accessibility, and user convenience in portable power management.

\subsection{Integration of Theories}
All three theories collectively form the foundation of this study. The Rental System Theory provides the framework for automating the process of accessing, reserving, and paying for detachable power units through a combination of digital applications and physical mechanisms, ensuring efficient and user-centered rental transactions. The Sustainable Energy and Portable Power Theory establishes the system’s grounding on renewable and off-grid energy utilization, promoting sustainability and operational resilience through solar-powered charging and modular battery storage. Meanwhile, the Wireless Communication and Positioning Theory supports the integration of GPS and GSM modules that enable real-time monitoring, data transmission, and location tracking of the detachable power sources. Together, these theories support the development of KURYENTA: Solar-Powered Rental Station with Detachable Power Sources, a coin-operated, GPS-enabled, and solar-powered system designed to deliver accessible and sustainable portable energy solutions to users.

The study concludes that solar energy plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable development, reducing climate change impacts, and driving economic growth. With ongoing technological advancements and effective policies, solar power is set to be a key component of the future energy system.

\subsection{Power Consumption of Household Appliances }

Power consumption patterns in households are significantly influenced by the frequency and duration of appliance usage. Pulvera (2021) found that household appliances such as televisions, electric fans, and refrigerators are among the most frequently used devices, contributing considerably to total electricity consumption. The results revealed that the television set operates for an average of forty-four (44) hours per week, followed by the electric fan with fifty-one (51) hours, and the refrigerator with one hundred five (105) hours of usage weekly. These appliances are commonly prioritized for their essential roles in providing comfort, entertainment, and food preservation within the household.

Pulvera (2021) further emphasized that electricity usage is affected by several factors, including low voltage supply, appliance wattage, power interruptions, standby power, and user behavior. Among these, user awareness and proper energy management play a crucial role in reducing unnecessary power consumption. The continuous use of high-demand appliances such as electric fans and refrigerators, especially in tropical climates like the Philippines, highlights the dependence of households on these devices for maintaining comfort during hot weather and ensuring food preservation. Consequently, understanding the frequency of appliance use helps identify energy-saving opportunities and promote consumer awareness.

\subsection{Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority}

Battery selection plays a critical role in optimizing the performance and sustainability of photovoltaic (PV) systems. According to the Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA, 2024) under the Government of Sierra Leone, three major battery options are typically considered in solar power applications—Flooded Lead Acid, Sealed Lead Acid (SLA), and Lithium Iron Phosphate (\ce{LiFePO4}). The study highlighted that \ce{LiFePO4} batteries are preferred for the Regional Emergency Solar Power Intervention (RESPITE) Project due to their superior efficiency, longevity, and environmental advantages.

\ce{LiFePO4} batteries are generally more energy-efficient, allowing for greater energy utilization and reduced losses during charging and discharging. In contrast, SLA batteries exhibit lower efficiency, which can result in higher energy wastage. Additionally, \ce{LiFePO4} batteries support a higher depth of discharge (DoD), enabling deeper energy use without significantly affecting their lifespan. This characteristic makes them more suitable for daily solar energy cycling compared to SLA batteries, which tend to degrade faster under similar conditions.

Another major advantage of \ce{LiFePO4} technology is its longer cycle life. The EDSA (2024) report notes that \ce{LiFePO4} batteries can endure more charge-discharge cycles before their performance diminishes, offering better long-term reliability. They also possess higher energy density, meaning they can store more energy in a smaller physical footprint—an important factor when space constraints exist in solar installations.

In terms of maintenance, \ce{LiFePO4} batteries are maintenance-free, unlike SLA batteries which often require periodic electrolyte checks and refilling. While \ce{LiFePO4} batteries have a higher upfront cost, they compensate with lower operational and maintenance expenses throughout their lifespan. From an environmental perspective, \ce{LiFePO4} batteries are also less harmful and easier to dispose of or recycle compared to lead-acid types, which generate toxic emissions during recycling.

\subsection{Assessing the Impact of Power Outages on Appliances of Farmers and Fisherfolks in Selected Barangays of Cawayan, Masbate, Philippines: Basis for a Proposed Extension Program}

Frequent power interruptions have long been a challenge in rural communities, particularly among those who depend on electricity for household and livelihood activities. The study aimed to determine the impact of frequent power interruptions on the appliances and economic well-being of residents in selected barangays of Cawayan, Masbate. Employing a descriptive research design, the researchers gathered data from 266 respondents through paper surveys and face-to-face interviews to assess the frequency, duration, and effects of power interruptions. Findings revealed that almost all respondents experienced power interruptions lasting three to four hours, leading to increased electricity consumption and higher bills. Refrigerators and televisions were the most power-consuming appliances, and there was significant damage to appliances, especially bulbs, as well as disruptions to income-generating activities. The study results showed that many respondents had an annual income of less than \textpeso18,200, which was considered low and may have resulted in difficulty in paying high bills brought by power outages. All respondents relied on the power grid as their source of electricity, and power interruptions were a common occurrence. The data revealed that 97.7\% of respondents experienced power interruptions, with 51.1\% experiencing 3-4 hours of interruption. Almost all respondents claimed that power interruption increased their electric consumption and bill, and 56\% were not satisfied with their electric bill when there was a power interruption. It was concluded that unreliable electricity supply and lack of maintenance significantly affect low-income households that rely solely on the power grid as their source of electricity. The study recommended strengthening local power infrastructure and promoting renewable energy education through a proposed extension project that trains communities in the use of solar energy as a sustainable and reliable alternative to the current power grid system. This helps reduce air pollution and climate change while building the capacity of farmers and fishers to adapt to these changes.

\subsection{Synthesis}

The reviewed literature highlights the progress made in solar-powered portable energy systems, especially for off-grid communities facing frequent power interruptions and power emergencies. Studies like those by Gozano et al. (2023), Oluwasegun et al. (2018), and Ramly et al. (2019) developed solar-based systems that integrated photovoltaic panels, charge controllers, batteries, and inverters. However, these systems often lacked sufficient energy storage capacity, limiting their ability to provide continuous power for communities that rely heavily on energy for daily appliances such as refrigerators and fans. Studies by Abdur et al. (2024) and Altelmessani et al. (2024) incorporated more advanced energy management through battery monitoring and load management systems but still did not fully address the integration of high-capacity energy storage and secure access for users. The gap in addressing these challenges highlights the need for a more efficient and accessible solar energy system for communities affected by power disruptions.

A significant gap in the existing literature lies in the choice of energy storage solutions. Many studies employed Lead-Acid batteries, which are still common in many solar power systems. For example, Oluwasegun et al. (2018) used a 12V Lead-Acid battery, which is cheaper but comes with limitations, including lower efficiency, shorter cycle life, and higher maintenance requirements. Lead-Acid batteries are typically less efficient, with a cycle life of about 500 to 1,000 cycles. In contrast, the proposed system utilizes \ce{LiFePO4} (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries which is a better  alternative. According to EDSA (2024) and Zakri et al. (2021), \ce{LiFePO4} batteries offer several advantages, including a much higher cycle life (more than 2,000 cycles), greater depth of discharge (DoD), and better overall efficiency, making them ideal for systems that undergo frequent charge-discharge cycles. These batteries are also more environmentally friendly and require less maintenance than their lead-acid counterparts. The \ce{LiFePO4} battery selected for the proposed system offers reliable energy storage with a high energy density, ensuring longer-lasting and more sustainable power for the solar-powered rental station.

Additionally, a notable gap in the literature is the lack of secure, rental-based access mechanisms for solar energy systems. While studies like Catalan et al. (2023) explored solar-powered coin-operated charging stations, they primarily focused on mobile charging rather than integrated power solutions for household or community use. The current study addresses this gap by incorporating a coin-slot mechanism with a solenoid lock for secure, pay-per-use access, ensuring that only authorized users can access the stored energy. Moreover, the integration of IoT-based monitoring through the ESP32 microcontroller, GPS, and GSM modules provides tracking of battery levels, usage statistics, and system status, which has not been fully explored in previous research. Rehman et al. (2024) highlighted the use of IoT for monitoring in solar-powered devices, but their research focused on charging stations for mobile devices rather than community-based energy solutions. The integration of a mobile app for monitoring battery charge levels and energy consumption ensures that users have full visibility into the system’s performance.

Furthermore, the proposed system's combination of a solar panel, \ce{LiFePO4} battery, MPPT charge controller, and AC inverter ensures that the system is capable of powering small to medium-sized appliances, such as refrigerators and fans, which are commonly used in Filipino households as noted in the studies by Pulvera (2021) and Masbate (2024). This integrated approach addresses a crucial need for accessible and reliable energy solutions in communities that frequently face power interruptions. The system’s scalability and eco-friendly design, driven by high-capacity \ce{LiFePO4} batteries, secure rental features, and smart monitoring systems, provide a comprehensive solution that builds on existing research while filling the gap in accessible and sustainable solar energy solutions for off-grid communities.
