Figiure 2.1 explains how the solar-powered rental station works from input to output. Inputs are what the system receives: solar energy that charges the main batteries, user actions on the screen or buttons, coins or points used for payment, and location data from GPS/GSM for tracking. The system then processes these inputs. It captures the user’s choice, checks and records the payment, manages the batteries by charging them and checking their levels, and updates each unit’s location. It also combines all this information so everything stays in sync, and it runs the points feature so unused energy can turn into rewards.

After processing, the system produces clear outputs that users and operators can see. It shows which portable power sources are available to rent, confirms that the payment went through, and displays the battery percentage of each unit before checkout. It also updates the user’s points, both the unused-energy points earned and the total points saved, and keeps the tracking information current, so rented units can be monitored in real time. This flow makes the station easy to use, transparent, and secure.

\end{figure}


Figure 2.2 illustrates the step-by-step process of how the proposed system functions, beginning with energy harvesting and ending with user access to the detachable power source. The process starts when photovoltaic (PV) panels capture solar energy and convert it into electricity. This electricity is then stored in the LiFePO4 battery, ensuring a reliable and long-lasting power supply. To make the stored energy usable for different devices, the system employs an inverter, which converts the direct current (DC) from the battery into alternating current (AC). Next, the ESP32 microcontroller, integrated with IoT mechanisms, monitors and manages the flow of energy. Through this control unit, real-time data such as battery charge level and system status can be tracked. Supporting modules such as GPS (for location tracking) and GSM (for wireless communication) enhance the monitoring and management of the system, particularly for rented power sources. For the rental mechanism, the system is equipped with a coin slot or app-based access system that unlocks the detachable power source through a solenoid lock. Once accessed, the user can rent and carry the power source for portable use, such as charging appliances or gadgets during power interruptions. The accompanying mobile application provides the renter with real-time updates on the battery level, usage duration, and system availability. Lastly, once the power source is returned, the system resets and recharges through solar harvesting, making it ready for the next user. This cyclical process ensures that the system remains sustainable, user-friendly, and reliable for communities experiencing frequent and unscheduled power interruptions.

The continuous use of high-demand appliances such as electric fans and refrigerators, especially in tropical climates like the Philippines, highlights the dependence of households on these devices for maintaining comfort during hot weather and ensuring food preservation. Consequently, understanding the frequency of appliance use helps identify energy-saving opportunities and promote consumer awareness.

\subsection{Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority}

Battery selection plays a critical role in optimizing the performance and sustainability of photovoltaic (PV) systems. According to the Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA, 2024) under the Government of Sierra Leone, three major battery options are typically considered in solar power applications—Flooded Lead Acid, Sealed Lead Acid (SLA), and Lithium Iron Phosphate (\ce{LiFePO4}). The study highlighted that \ce{LiFePO4} batteries are preferred for the Regional Emergency Solar Power Intervention (RESPITE) Project due to their superior efficiency, longevity, and environmental advantages.

\ce{LiFePO4} batteries are generally more energy-efficient, allowing for greater energy utilization and reduced losses during charging and discharging. In contrast, SLA batteries exhibit lower efficiency, which can result in higher energy wastage. Additionally, \ce{LiFePO4} batteries support a higher depth of discharge (DoD), enabling deeper energy use without significantly affecting their lifespan. This characteristic makes them more suitable for daily solar energy cycling compared to SLA batteries, which tend to degrade faster under similar conditions.

Another major advantage of \ce{LiFePO4} technology is its longer cycle life. The EDSA (2024) report notes that \ce{LiFePO4} batteries can endure more charge-discharge cycles before their performance diminishes, offering better long-term reliability. They also possess higher energy density, meaning they can store more energy in a smaller physical footprint—an important factor when space constraints exist in solar installations.

In terms of maintenance, \ce{LiFePO4} batteries are maintenance-free, unlike SLA batteries which often require periodic electrolyte checks and refilling. While \ce{LiFePO4} batteries have a higher upfront cost, they compensate with lower operational and maintenance expenses throughout their lifespan. From an environmental perspective, \ce{LiFePO4} batteries are also less harmful and easier to dispose of or recycle compared to lead-acid types, which generate toxic emissions during recycling.

\subsection{Assessing the Impact of Power Outages on Appliances of Farmers and Fisherfolks in Selected Barangays of Cawayan, Masbate, Philippines: Basis for a Proposed Extension Program}

Frequent power interruptions have long been a challenge in rural communities, particularly among farmers and fisherfolk who depend on electricity for household and livelihood activities. The study aimed to determine the impact of frequent power interruptions on the appliances and economic well-being of residents in selected barangays of Cawayan, Masbate. Employing a descriptive research design, the researchers gathered data from 266 respondents through paper surveys and face-to-face interviews to assess the frequency, duration, and effects of power interruptions. Findings revealed that almost all respondents experienced power interruptions lasting three to four hours, leading to increased electricity consumption and higher bills. Refrigerators and televisions were the most power-consuming appliances, and there was significant damage to appliances, especially bulbs, as well as disruptions to income-generating activities. The study results showed that many respondents had an annual income of less than \textpeso18,200, which was considered low and may have resulted in difficulty in paying high bills brought by power outages. All respondents relied on the power grid as their source of electricity, and power interruptions were a common occurrence. The data revealed that 97.7\% of respondents experienced power interruptions, with 51.1\% experiencing 3-4 hours of interruption. Almost all respondents claimed that power interruption increased their electric consumption and bill, and 56\% were not satisfied with their electric bill when there was a power interruption. It was concluded that unreliable electricity supply and lack of maintenance significantly affect low-income households that rely solely on the power grid as their source of electricity. The study recommended strengthening local power infrastructure and promoting renewable energy education through a proposed extension project that trains communities in the use of solar energy as a sustainable and reliable alternative to the current power grid system. This helps reduce air pollution and climate change while building the capacity of farmers and fishers to adapt to these changes.

It was concluded that the solar-powered charging station is a practical and eco-friendly innovation that promotes energy resilience in communities affected by power outages. The study recommended installing such systems in strategic locations for communal purposes and remote areas, integrating security features to prevent misuse, and conducting further research to enhance its technological design and promote the widespread adoption of renewable energy solutions.

\subsection{Synthesis}

The reviewed literature collectively highlighted the potential of solar-powered systems such as several power sources, mostly portable power stations as sustainable energy solutions, especially in off-grid and rural areas where power interruptions are common. Studies by Gozano et al. (2023), Oluwasegun et al. (2018), and Ramly et al. (2019) developed solar-based portable power supplies that integrated photovoltaic panels, charge controllers, batteries, and inverters. While Rehman et al. (2024) integrated IoT for real-time monitoring and efficiency optimization, later research by Abdur et al. (2024) and Altelmessani et al. (2024) enhanced system functioning through battery management and load monitoring systems. The suggested system’s use of an ESP32 microcontroller, GPS and GSM modules, and LCD-based monitoring for energy tracking and operational management directly demonstrates these works’ focus on  the importance of effective energy harvesting, battery management, inverter stability, and smart control for system reliability.

The importance of choosing appropriate energy storage methods is also emphasized by a number of studies. Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries are preferred to conventional lead-acid batteries because of their longer cycle life, higher efficiency, and maintenance-free operation, which makes them suitable for solar-powered systems with frequent charge-discharge cycles in accordance to EDSA (2024), and Zakri et. al (2021). Moreover, the Masbate (2024) study and Pulvera (2021) illustrate how heavily Filipino households depend on devices like fans, televisions, and refrigerators which are often affected by power interruptions. 


This insight emphasizes the necessity of accessible and reasonably priced renewable energy sources that can sustain necessary home loads. Moreover, Catalan et al. (2023) demonstrated that coin-operated solar-powered charging stations effectively promote energy access and sustainability, supporting the integration of a coin-slot mechanism and solenoid lock for secure, pay-per-use operations in community-based systems.

A significant study gap still exists in the integration of several key elements into a single deployable system, even if these studies collectively validate the effectiveness and feasibility of portable solar systems.	An IoT-enabled monitoring and tracking system, a rental-based model with detachable power sources, and secure access mechanisms intended for community users are not offered in the literature currently in publication. A 2x2 solar panel array, an MPPT charge controller, a LiFePO4 battery for effective energy storage, and an inverter for AC conversion are all integrated into the proposed Solar-Powered Rental Station with Detachable Power Sources to address the problem at hand. 

The system integrates ESP32-based monitoring, GSM and GPS connectivity, and a coin-slot mechanism for secure and traceable rentals, with a mobile application for real-time battery monitoring. By combining sustainable energy harvesting and smart control, it offers a practical and eco-friendly solution to power interruptions in communities. In summary, the synthesis of current literature highlights the importance of integrating efficient solar energy systems, smart monitoring, reliable storage, and accessible user feature concepts that form the foundation of the proposed Solar-Powered Rental Station with Detachable Power Sources.
